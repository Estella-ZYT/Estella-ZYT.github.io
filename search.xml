    <title>Records about FBLA</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Between 6th and 9th of February, I attended the final of the competition Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). </p>
<p>It was pity that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the competition could only be held online. In order to provide a more reliable environment for the competition, the organizing committee had set up a website specially for it and we were given the accounts and passwords to log in.</p>
<p>I was really surprised after the competition started, because I found besides the competition, there were other interesting things to do in our spare time. The website was divided into different sections named as <em>Ceremonies, Presentation Rooms, Test rooms, Future Friends</em> and <em>Value Creators</em>. In addition to the first three sections, which had literal functions, the remaining two sections provided participants with opportunities for socialization and entertainment. </p>
<p><em>Value Creators</em> was a game where participants in groups of five ran businesses in simulation. Each person managed a department, like accounting and finance or advertising, by choosing a card (used to make business decisions) every round. The decisions would affect the profits directly. A majority of the participants joined this game, but after a few rounds, most companies suffered huge losses, even up to billions of yuan! Perhaps we didn’t understand the rules or the prompts on the decision cards well, but it also showed that lots of efforts were needed to use theoretical knowledge properly in practical situations.</p>
<p><em>Future Friends</em> was a platform where we could send and view the posts. The rules for it were different from those of microblog. When someone sent a post, only the keywords were first shown as a title, and if you wanted to view the whole contents, you had to send a request. The receiver would check keywords of your posts and decided whether to accept to exchange information. There was also a ranking list showing the most popular post (which means it was exchanged the most times). To make more people interested in their posts, the participants had to think of keywords that could catch others’ eyes at the first glance. It wasn’t an easy task, because we need to know clearly about what hot issues participants were most interested in. This, in some ways, involved psychological knowledge. I concluded several ways that were most effective in attracting attention from the posts at the top of the ranking lists. The first way, as well as the simplest way, was to contain one or more hot issues as keywords (e.g. U.S. stocks analysis, fashion trends, hip-hop music, jazz and movies), and people interested in any of the issues may want to exchange. Secondly, the bloggers may make use of participants’ expectations for good grades. For example, one post had the title “Answers to tomorrow’s base event”, which immediately ranked first after posting. Another showed “Come and request. Wish you a good grade” and this also won a high place on the list. In addition, a post could be favourable due to its high-quality contents which were usually the bloggers’ own ideas from their experience. The typical example was the No.1 post at the end of the competition, which was a long article about how to get good grades in sports.</p>
<p>The posts to be exchanged were just like the products to be sold. Bloggers needed to design a product that could attract as much attention as possible. In addition to the product itself (contents of the posts), the way to advertise the product (title of the posts) is also important to a company. I really enjoyed this part of competition, for it brought business ideas into our life in a fun and appropriate way.</p>
<p>In order to make it more possible for participants to get good grades, extra individual events were set. I chose the tests about business calculations and business communication. But business had much more aspects than I thought: agribusiness, business etiquette, business law, business math &amp; financial literacy, career exploration, cyber security, digital citizenship, elevator speech, health care administration, insurance &amp; risk management, …… some of which I didn’t even know what they were! This was a quite unexpected discovery.</p>
<p>There were some mistakes I made during the four days that should be recorded as cautions for the future. One was that in the team project, the power point of our business plan couldn’t be shown properly, and this caused we didn’t finish our presentation because of the time limit. Though we had mock before the formal competition, we didn’t present in the way completely same as the formal one. Another mistake was I didn’t check my test ID and left the blank for it unfilled. Fortunately, this didn’t lead to serious consequence because many other candidates made the same mistake, and the organizing committee didn’t cancel our grades, but this was certainly a mistake I should never make again.</p>
<p>It was my first time to attend in such a big competition, and I did have a further understanding of what business was like due to the experience. What’s more, I really hope that I can attend an offline FBLA competition someday.</p>

    <title>A Little Red Flower</title>
    <url>/2021/02/23/A-Little-Red-Flower/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="——-To-all-those-who-live-actively"><a href="#——-To-all-those-who-live-actively" class="headerlink" title="—— To all those who live actively"></a>—— To all those who live actively</h3><hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“My name is Wei Yihang. Do you want to see my brain tumor section?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The hero Wei Yihang is withdrawn because of cancer. He doesn’t want to associate with anyone, and the only words he says to introduce himself are in the sentence above. Things doesn’t change until he met Ma Xiaoyuan, a girl who also has cancer but is still cheerful and lively.</p>
<p>  Ma Xiaoyuan is like a beam of sunshine, lighting up Wei’s original dark life. It is hard to imagine that a person with cancer can live as simple and happy as Ma Xiaoyuan does. After learning that Wei Yihang enjoys explorations but cannot travel far away from home because of his physical condition, she manages to let him travel “around the world” in the small city they live in. Together, they feel the sea breeze at the “white sand beach” in the vegetable market; they watch penguins in the “Antarctic” in the cold storage; they swim in the “Dead Sea” in the pool; they cross the “Sahara Desert” on the sand piles of the construction site, and experience the “world’s largest waterfall” among the fountains of the square. In the past, though Wei Yihang always aspires to a normal life, he always separates himself from others because of illness. But during the time he gets along with Ma Xiaoyuan, he gradually opens up to others. When seeing them dancing in the square, among a group of old people, we seemed to see the fog lifting from his path to the future, and he would go for an ordinary and happy life till the old age.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At that moment, I realized the joy of being a normal person. Getting old like them is no longer out of reach.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The name of the film is A Little Red Flower. The little red flower is an element that runs through the whole film. It first appears when Wei Yihang says that he has never got a little red flower in kindergarten (kids who do well usually get red flowers from their teachers). Then, on a rainy night, Ma Xiaoyuan draws a little red flower on his hand for being frank to her.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What this is?”</p>
<p> “A little red flower. For taking the initiative for the first time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Ma Xiaoyuan is seriously ill, Wei Yihang draws one for her as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “What if we wander off? “<br>  “ Then just raise your arm in the crowd, and I’ll run to you as soon as I see the little red flower. “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, the little red flower symbolizes hope. Longing for hope at the beginning, Wei Yihang is finally able to pass on hope to others. Love and hope are among the most important themes of the film. Cancer is a heavy topic, but many people still love the world though they have to face the misery of fate. For instance, Wei Yihang’s mother has always quibbled over small amount of money, but once she gives 100 yuan generously to a woman asking for money to raise her child. Perhaps it is because at that moment, she empathizes with the mother’s helplessness and love for her child. Also, after his lover died of cancer, Wu Xiaomei sets up a club for cancer patients and opens a barber shop, encouraging one patient after another. At the beginning of the film, someone gives an inspirational speech in a meeting held by the patients, and all the patients are touched by him. However, Wei Yihang criticizes that the contents of speech are totally useless self-deception, because it makes no difference to their illness. Do the listeners really not understand what Wei Yihang means? Not necessarily. But they still want to believe in the inspiring sentences that they can overcome the diseases and live a healthy and happy life.</p>
<p>  The film makes an ingenious combination of fairy tales and the real world. Ma Xiaoyuan is like a character in a fairy tale. She is beautiful and optimistic with a warm smile on the face. Unfortunately, she leaves the world at the end. The director made the scene short and silent, but the audience were pulled back to the reality immediately, with inexpressible pain and sorrow rising from the bottom of heart. It is tragic, but also realistic. How fragile the beautiful things are. However, on the basis of reality, the film pays more attention to the ideal and hopeful side. The “parallel world” mentioned many times is also like a world of fairy tales. The world is like what Ma Xiaoyuan describes to Wei Yihang:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you believe that somewhere out there, there’s a version of you that never got sick? And then he went to school like a normal kid. He graduated, and became a little adventurer.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also like what Wei Yihang has in mind after Ma Xiaoyuan passes away:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a world without pain and sadness. In that world, there is a perfectly healthy son, and there is a perfectly healthy daughter. It never snows there, nor is there wind. The place has stayed the same for eons of time. Everyone is living a life of their dreams. Simple and beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  In that world, Wei Yihang and Ma Xiaoyuan are both healthy. Wu Xiaomei becomes a crosstalk actor, spreading laughter and living an ideal life with his lover. The old woman’s granddaughter isn’t lost. She picks her up from school every day. The father’s daughter doesn’t pass away because of cancer. They have a great time riding on the merry-go-round in an amusement park. In the film scenes, the world is full of bright white. It is like a pure and beautiful fairy tale.</p>
<p>  What is the significance of fairy tales? In my view, it carries people’s yearning and pursuit of nice things, and it brings the world a sense of light. Fairy tales may be imaginary, but they can transmit faith and strength, which let people be more courageous when facing the hardship in real life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Life is hard, but don’t give up love and hope. Every brave man who fights against the trend and fate deserves to be rewarded with a “little red flower”.</p>
