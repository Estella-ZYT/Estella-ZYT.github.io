<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; &quot;My name is Wei Yihang. Do you want to see my brain tumor section?&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>  The hero Wei Yihang was withdrawn because of cancer. He didn’t want to associate with anyone, and the only words he said to introduce himself were in the sentence above. Things didn’t change until he met Ma Xiaoyuan, a girl who also had cancer but was still cheerful and lively.</p>
<p>  Ma Xiaoyuan was like a beam of sunshine, lighting up Wei’s original dark life. It was hard to imagine that a person with cancer could live as simple and happy as Ma Xiaoyuan. After learning that Wei Yihang enjoyed to explore but couldn’t travel far away from home because of his physical condition, she managed to let him travel “around the world” in the small city they lived in. Together, they felt the sea breeze at the “white sand beach” in the vegetable market; they watched penguins in the “Antarctic” in the cold storage; they swam in the “Dead Sea” in the pool; they crossed the “Sahara Desert” on the sand piles of the construction site, and experienced the “world’s largest waterfall” among the fountains of the square. In the past, though Wei Yihang had always aspired to a normal life, he always separated himself from others because of illness. But during the time he got along with Ma Xiaoyuan, he gradually opened up to others. When seeing them dancing in the square, among a group of old people, we seemed to see the fog lifting from his path to the future, and he would go for an ordinary and happy life till the old age.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; &quot;At that moment, I realized the joy of being a normal person. Getting old like them is no longer out of reach.”</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>  The name of the film is A Little Red Flower. The little red flower is an element that runs through the whole film. It first appeared when Wei Yihang said that he had never got a little red flower in kindergarten (kids who do well usually get red flowers from their teachers). Then, on a rainy night, Ma Xiaoyuan drew a little red flower on his hand for being frank to her.  </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; “What this is?”</span><br><span class="line">  “A little red flower. For taking the initiative for the first time.”</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>When Ma Xiaoyuan was seriously ill, Wei Yihang drew one for her as well.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; &quot;What if we wander off? &quot; </span><br><span class="line">  &quot; Then just raise your arm in the crowd, and I&#39;ll run to you as soon as I see the little red flower. &quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In my opinion, the little red flower symbolizes hope. Longing for hope at the beginning, Wei Yihang was finally able to pass on hope to others. Love and hope are among the most important themes of the film. Cancer is a heavy topic, but many people still love the world though they have to face the misery of fate. For instance, Wei Yihang’s mother had always quibbled over small amount of money, but once she gave 100 yuan generously to a woman asking for money to raise her child. Perhaps it was because at that moment, she empathized with the mother’s helplessness and love for her child. Also, after his lover died of cancer, Wu Xiaomei set up a club for cancer patients and opened a barber shop, encouraging one patient after another. At the beginning of the film, someone gave an inspirational speech in a meeting held by the patients, and all the patients were moved by him. However, Wei Yihang criticized that the content of speech was totally useless self-deception, because it made no difference to their illness. Did the listeners really not understand what Wei Yihang meant? Not necessarily. But they still wanted to believe in the inspiring sentences that they could overcome the diseases and live a healthy and happy life.</p>
<p>  The film makes an ingenious combination of fairy tales and the real world. Ma Xiaoyuan was like a character in a fairy tale. She was beautiful and optimistic with a warm smile on the face. Unfortunately, she left the world at the end. The director made the scene short and silent, but the audience were pulled back to the reality immediately, with inexpressible pain and sorrow rising from the bottom of heart. It was tragic, but also realistic. How fragile the beautiful things were. However, on the basis of reality, the film pays more attention to the ideal and hopeful side. The “parallel world” mentioned many times is also like a world of fairy tales. The world is like what Ma Xiaoyuan said to Wei Yihang:  </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; &quot;Do you believe that somewhere out there, there’s a version of you that never got sick? And then he went to school like a normal kid. He graduated, and became a little adventurer.&quot; </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>It is also like what Wei Yihang had in mind after Ma Xiaoyuan passed away:  </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; There is a world without pain and sadness. In that world, there is a perfectly healthy son, and there is a perfectly healthy daughter. It never snows there, nor is there wind. The place has stayed the same for eons of time. Everyone is living a life of their dreams. Simple and beautiful.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>  In that world, Wei Yihang and Ma Xiaoyuan are both healthy. Wu Xiaomei becomes a crosstalk actor, spreading laughter and living an ideal life with his lover. The old woman’s granddaughter isn’t lost. She picks her up from school every day. The father’s daughter doesn’t pass away because of cancer. They have a great time riding on the merry-go-round in an amusement park. In the film scene, the world is full of bright white. It is a pure and beautiful fairy tale.</p>
<p>  What is the significance of fairy tales? In my view, it carries people’s yearning and pursuit of nice things, and it brings the world a sense of light. Fairy tales may be imaginary, but they can transmit faith and strength, which let people be more courageous when facing the hardship in real life.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; Life is hard, but don&#39;t give up love and hope. Every brave man who fights against the trend and fate deserves to be rewarded with a &quot;little red flower&quot;.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
