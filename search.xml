    <title>A Little Red Flower</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>To all those who live actively</strong></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“My name is Wei Yihang. Do you want to see my brain tumor section?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The hero Wei Yihang is withdrawn because of cancer. He doesn’t want to associate with anyone, and the only words he says to introduce himself are in the sentence above. Things doesn’t change until he met Ma Xiaoyuan, a girl who also has cancer but is still cheerful and lively.</p>
<p>  Ma Xiaoyuan is like a beam of sunshine, lighting up Wei’s original dark life. It is hard to imagine that a person with cancer can live as simple and happy as Ma Xiaoyuan does. After learning that Wei Yihang enjoys explorations but cannot travel far away from home because of his physical condition, she manages to let him travel “around the world” in the small city they live in. Together, they feel the sea breeze at the “white sand beach” in the vegetable market; they watch penguins in the “Antarctic” in the cold storage; they swim in the “Dead Sea” in the pool; they cross the “Sahara Desert” on the sand piles of the construction site, and experience the “world’s largest waterfall” among the fountains of the square. In the past, though Wei Yihang always aspires to a normal life, he always separates himself from others because of illness. But during the time he gets along with Ma Xiaoyuan, he gradually opens up to others. When seeing them dancing in the square, among a group of old people, we seemed to see the fog lifting from his path to the future, and he would go for an ordinary and happy life till the old age.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At that moment, I realized the joy of being a normal person. Getting old like them is no longer out of reach.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The name of the film is A Little Red Flower. The little red flower is an element that runs through the whole film. It first appears when Wei Yihang says that he has never got a little red flower in kindergarten (kids who do well usually get red flowers from their teachers). Then, on a rainy night, Ma Xiaoyuan draws a little red flower on his hand for being frank to her.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What this is?”</p>
<p> “A little red flower. For taking the initiative for the first time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Ma Xiaoyuan is seriously ill, Wei Yihang draws one for her as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “What if we wander off? “<br>  “ Then just raise your arm in the crowd, and I’ll run to you as soon as I see the little red flower. “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, the little red flower symbolizes hope. Longing for hope at the beginning, Wei Yihang is finally able to pass on hope to others. Love and hope are among the most important themes of the film. Cancer is a heavy topic, but many people still love the world though they have to face the misery of fate. For instance, Wei Yihang’s mother has always quibbled over small amount of money, but once she gives 100 yuan generously to a woman asking for money to raise her child. Perhaps it is because at that moment, she empathizes with the mother’s helplessness and love for her child. Also, after his lover died of cancer, Wu Xiaomei sets up a club for cancer patients and opens a barber shop, encouraging one patient after another. At the beginning of the film, someone gives an inspirational speech in a meeting held by the patients, and all the patients are touched by him. However, Wei Yihang criticizes that the contents of speech are totally useless self-deception, because it makes no difference to their illness. Do the listeners really not understand what Wei Yihang means? Not necessarily. But they still want to believe in the inspiring sentences that they can overcome the diseases and live a healthy and happy life.</p>
<p>  The film makes an ingenious combination of fairy tales and the real world. Ma Xiaoyuan is like a character in a fairy tale. She is beautiful and optimistic with a warm smile on the face. Unfortunately, she leaves the world at the end. The director made the scene short and silent, but the audience were pulled back to the reality immediately, with inexpressible pain and sorrow rising from the bottom of heart. It is tragic, but also realistic. How fragile the beautiful things are. However, on the basis of reality, the film pays more attention to the ideal and hopeful side. The “parallel world” mentioned many times is also like a world of fairy tales. The world is like what Ma Xiaoyuan describes to Wei Yihang:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you believe that somewhere out there, there’s a version of you that never got sick? And then he went to school like a normal kid. He graduated, and became a little adventurer.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also like what Wei Yihang has in mind after Ma Xiaoyuan passes away:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a world without pain and sadness. In that world, there is a perfectly healthy son, and there is a perfectly healthy daughter. It never snows there, nor is there wind. The place has stayed the same for eons of time. Everyone is living a life of their dreams. Simple and beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  In that world, Wei Yihang and Ma Xiaoyuan are both healthy. Wu Xiaomei becomes a crosstalk actor, spreading laughter and living an ideal life with his lover. The old woman’s granddaughter isn’t lost. She picks her up from school every day. The father’s daughter doesn’t pass away because of cancer. They have a great time riding on the merry-go-round in an amusement park. In the film scenes, the world is full of bright white. It is like a pure and beautiful fairy tale.</p>
<p>  What is the significance of fairy tales? In my view, it carries people’s yearning and pursuit of nice things, and it brings the world a sense of light. Fairy tales may be imaginary, but they can transmit faith and strength, which let people be more courageous when facing the hardship in real life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Life is hard, but don’t give up love and hope. Every brave man who fights against the trend and fate deserves to be rewarded with a “little red flower”.</p>

    <title>Records about FBLA</title>
    <url>/2021/02/15/Records-about-FBLA/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Between 6th and 9th of February, I attended the final of the competition Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). </p>
<p>It was pity that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the competition could only be held online. In order to provide a more reliable environment for the competition, the organizing committee had set up a website specially for it and we were given the accounts and passwords to log in.</p>
<p>I was really surprised after the competition started, because I found besides the competition, there were other interesting things to do in our spare time. The website was divided into different sections named as <em>Ceremonies, Presentation Rooms, Test rooms, Future Friends</em> and <em>Value Creators</em>. In addition to the first three sections, which had literal functions, the remaining two sections provided participants with opportunities for socialization and entertainment. </p>
<p><em>Value Creators</em> was a game where participants in groups of five ran businesses in simulation. Each person managed a department, like accounting and finance or advertising, by choosing a card (used to make business decisions) every round. The decisions would affect the profits directly. A majority of the participants joined this game, but after a few rounds, most companies suffered huge losses, even up to billions of yuan! Perhaps we didn’t understand the rules or the prompts on the decision cards well, but it also showed that lots of efforts were needed to use theoretical knowledge properly in practical situations.</p>
<p><em>Future Friends</em> was a platform where we could send and view the posts. The rules for it were different from those of microblog. When someone sent a post, only the keywords were first shown as a title, and if you wanted to view the whole contents, you had to send a request. The receiver would check keywords of your posts and decided whether to accept to exchange information. There was also a ranking list showing the most popular post (which means it was exchanged the most times). To make more people interested in their posts, the participants had to think of keywords that could catch others’ eyes at the first glance. It wasn’t an easy task, because we need to know clearly about what hot issues participants were most interested in. This, in some ways, involved psychological knowledge. I concluded several ways that were most effective in attracting attention from the posts at the top of the ranking lists. The first way, as well as the simplest way, was to contain one or more hot issues as keywords (e.g. U.S. stocks analysis, fashion trends, hip-hop music, jazz and movies), and people interested in any of the issues may want to exchange. Secondly, the bloggers may make use of participants’ expectations for good grades. For example, one post had the title “Answers to tomorrow’s base event”, which immediately ranked first after posting. Another showed “Come and request. Wish you a good grade” and this also won a high place on the list. In addition, a post could be favourable due to its high-quality contents which were usually the bloggers’ own ideas from their experience. The typical example was the No.1 post at the end of the competition, which was a long article about how to get good grades in sports.</p>
<p>The posts to be exchanged were just like the products to be sold. Bloggers needed to design a product that could attract as much attention as possible. In addition to the product itself (contents of the posts), the way to advertise the product (title of the posts) is also important to a company. I really enjoyed this part of competition, for it brought business ideas into our life in a fun and appropriate way.</p>
<p>In order to make it more possible for participants to get good grades, extra individual events were set. I chose the tests about business calculations and business communication. But business had much more aspects than I thought: agribusiness, business etiquette, business law, business math &amp; financial literacy, career exploration, cyber security, digital citizenship, elevator speech, health care administration, insurance &amp; risk management, …… some of which I didn’t even know what they were! This was a quite unexpected discovery.</p>
<p>There were some mistakes I made during the four days that should be recorded as cautions for the future. One was that in the team project, the power point of our business plan couldn’t be shown properly, and this caused we didn’t finish our presentation because of the time limit. Though we had mock before the formal competition, we didn’t present in the way completely same as the formal one. Another mistake was I didn’t check my test ID and left the blank for it unfilled. Fortunately, this didn’t lead to serious consequence because many other candidates made the same mistake, and the organizing committee didn’t cancel our grades, but this was certainly a mistake I should never make again.</p>
<p>It was my first time to attend in such a big competition, and I did have a further understanding of what business was like due to the experience. What’s more, I really hope that I can attend an offline FBLA competition someday.</p>

    <title>The Little Prince</title>
    <url>/2021/01/16/The-Little-Prince/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of the book “The Little Prince”, you may immediately think of an innocent boy, a sheep hidden in a box, a delicate rose and a clever fox. This sounds like a fairy tale we heard when we were children, but in fact, there is something touching and powerful behind the simple words of this book. </p>
<p>The Little Prince is a famous work of children’s literature written by French writer Antoine in 1942. The main character of this book is the little prince from the asteroid B612. In the book, a pilot is taken as the narrator of the story. He tells the different experiences of the little prince. </p>
<p>From Antoine’s real-life experiences, we can find that he never gave up his dream of being a pilot no matter what the circumstances were. The pilot in the book is actually the author himself. The seemingly simple story of the little prince contains countless information related to the author’s life and his previous works. Almost every character and scene in the book has a strong suggestive effect. Antoine hides profound thoughts in the book, but the words used are so simple that even children can easily understand it.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the key word of the book is “soul”. It starts from the comparison of adults and children. In the book, there are many absurdities in the adult world, while children can keep a pure and clean mind. After meeting a king who is crazy about power, a vain man, a decadent drunkard, a greedy businessman, a stubborn lamplighter and a geographer who is divorced from reality, the little prince said, “How strange they are! “ Perhaps everyone thinks that these people are ridiculous, for the characters in the book are exaggerated. However, in the real life, people like them are countless, and even ourselves may be some of them. But are we aware of it? </p>
<p>The difference between adults and children lies in their souls. A child’s soul is pure. Every adult used to be such a child, but as they grow up, they know more about the world, power, money, vanity, which gradually become what they thirst for. These things are like a haze, covering their originally clean souls. The reason why the little prince thought they are strange is that they pay too much attention to the external things and lost their inner peace and happiness. There is a moving sentence in the book that I appreciate a lot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a box is drawn on the paper, everyone will say that it is a box. If someone insists that there is a sheep inside, he may be considered to be crazy. But the little prince is different. The pilot draws a box for him, telling him that there is a sheep inside. The little prince immediately accepts it with joy and says he see the sheep sleeping. At first, I thought he was just imagining, but then I found that the little prince’s world was so pure and beautiful that what we think unrealistic is real to him. In fact, compared with him, we almost lost the ability of “seeing”. Let’s ask ourselves: How long haven’t we “seen” the fragrance of a flower, the twinkling of a star, and the sweetness of a spring? And how long haven’t we felt the world with our heart. Therefore today, we cannot see the sleeping sheep in the box. </p>
<p>Another point is about love and responsibility. There are two important characters in this story, the rose and the fox. The little prince is confused about the meaning of his own rose after seeing more than 5000 similar roses in the garden. But the fox teaches him what is domestication, how to build connection and what is love. As mentioned in the preface:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value and meaning of life are created by actions in real life. In other words, external things or life itself are meaningless unless you give it one. To love a thing and a person is to give him a unique meaning in his life, and to take charge of the relationship that have been built is what we call responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> (I cannot find the English version so I translate the Chinese version myself.)</p>
<p>Even when facing separation from each other, the connection made by love will not be broken, because with this wonderful emotion, little things will remind you of the person or thing you love. As the book says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night… You – only you – will have stars that can laugh… </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The little prince symbolizes a pure and clear soul. Though the society is impetuous, we should still preserve our innocence, and keep a bright and peace corner in our heart.</p>

    <title>Significance of Voluntary Work</title>
    <url>/2021/03/12/Significance-of-Voluntary-Work/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It has been increasingly common that high school students do voluntary work in their spare time. People have different views on whether this should be regarded as an obligation of students in high school, and I totally support this view.</p>
<p>During the high school period, students’ capabilities are relatively strong, thus making them feel easier when dealing with community affairs than those at a younger age. Admittedly, since some of the students are probably unwilling to devote their spare time doing public service without payment, forcing them to do so may lead to several problems, like being half-hearted while serving or even developing negative attitudes towards society, but such cases will be rare if parents and teachers guide them correctly. </p>
<p>It may also be argued that doing unpaid community service may take up too much of students’ time and energy, which will interfere their studies and lead to their school work falling behind. However, I believe that this problem is not very serious if they use their time for recreation, like playing computer games or hanging out with friends, to accomplish these tasks. This doesn’t mean that students aren’t allowed to have private time to relax. Instead, they should try to achieve a better balance between schoolwork and rest. Furthermore, this is beneficial to students for the reason that they can learn practical skills through these experiences. For instance, to improve the environment of the neighbourhood, the students need clean up the streets, through which they can learn how to do some cleaning efficiently. Similarly, teaching younger children can train their ability of expression. These are important parts of education as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, the most convincing fact is that doing community service without payment can improve the moral character of students, because this can cultivate the students’ kindness and sense of responsibility which are important for them to be respectful. Education should teach students not only knowledge but also morality. By incorporating it into school curriculum, more and more people will develop positive personalities such as kindness and warm-heartedness. By contrast, if a student only focused on his schoolwork without spending any time helping in the community, he might become impersonal, instead of becoming a good person in society.</p>
<p>From another perspective, this can help build a better society as well. Firstly, since students improve their personal qualities through this curriculum, the social atmosphere will be better as a result, with more people willing to help others. Secondly, student volunteers can replace some of the community workers, therefore more effort could be devoted to other aspects of urban development. Moreover, such students are more likely to become experienced staff when being employed and make more contribution to enterprises or other organizations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am strongly in favour of the view that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs, for such experiences have positive influence on students’ mind and body, and can also help create a caring atmosphere of our society.</p>

    <title>Records about several competitions</title>
    <url>/2021/04/11/Records-for-several-competitions/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="About-AMC10-and-12"><a href="#About-AMC10-and-12" class="headerlink" title="About AMC10 and 12"></a>About AMC10 and 12</h3><p>I attended AMC10 on February 5 and AMC12 on February 11. Something unexpected through AMC10 was that I was too nervous and couldn’t think of methods to work out the questions, or even understand what they were asking for. As a result, I answered only about 15 questions (25 questions in all), which was far below my normal performance. In fact, I often worry about not getting good grades and thus feel anxious and tense before exams, but none was as serious as this time. I know that it’s necessary to keep a relaxed mind in such situations but it’s just hard for me to control my emotions. Anyway, I will try to avoid being too nervous next time.</p>
<p>I performed normally in AMC12, though there were still many questions left unanswered. My grade was only 1.5 points to enter AIME and it was really a pity, but that was not out of expectation. I was not familiar with the mathematical formulae and theorems needed for the competitions, and those are what I need to work on this year to gain a better understanding so that I may achieve a higher grades next time.</p>
<p>AMC contains 25 multiple choice questions but only lasts for 75 minutes, which means each question takes only 3 minutes on average. However, some of the questions are supper difficult and require more knowledge than we learn at school. Though I attended extra-curriculum courses on AMC, I still didn’t understand the knowledge well and had difficulty in putting them into practice.</p>
<h3 id="About-Physics-Bowl"><a href="#About-Physics-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="About Physics Bowl"></a>About Physics Bowl</h3><p>I have taken courses to prepare for the competition since October. This competition includes 40 multiple choice questions and lasts for only 45 minutes. However, the contents to be examined are very extensive and detailed, even more than what we can learn in A-level and IB courses. Therefore, finishing all the test paper in the limited time becomes much more difficult. Though I may know the methods and formulae needed and be able to work out the problems, I couldn’t attain this in such short time. In my view, the amount of knowledge required for the Physics Bowl was too massive for me to grasp even though I did lots of exercises, and all I could achieve was to remember the formulae and laws to the greatest extent and try to use them in the competition. I don’t think I will get a satisfying grade because I didn’t answer as many questions as I did in the mock, but I still think this experience is rewarding, for physics is intriguing and it will also make me learn this subject more easily in the following semesters.</p>
<h3 id="About-Euclid"><a href="#About-Euclid" class="headerlink" title="About Euclid"></a>About Euclid</h3><p>Different from the two competitions above, Euclid Contest consists of 10 questions including both short answer ones and full solution ones. Steps to work out the questions must be presented clearly on the answer sheet. </p>
<p>I thought the time was sufficient (2.5 hours), but writing the detailed solution took a lot of time and I didn’t have enough time to think deeply about the difficult ones at last. I still cannot determine whether it was wise to spend such long time on the questions which I was confident to answer correctly. I should have asked about the mark scheme before the contest. </p>
<p>The clearest feeling is that my knowledge is not board enough and I cannot use what I learnt skillfully to solve problems, which have a greater effect on the exams where the time is limited. I think the best way to enhance the mastery of knowledge is to do more exercises, and I will work on it through the following year. Besides, some of the contents will be contained in courses at school as well. I believe being more prepared the next time will lead to better results.</p>
